# Keyboard Coop Game

A fun 2-player cooperative word game where players take turns selecting adjacent letters on a QWERTY keyboard to form valid words.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Two players take turns at the same computer
2. **Turn System**: Player 1 starts by clicking any letter on the keyboard
3. **Adjacent Rule**: The next player must click a letter that is adjacent to the previously selected letter
4. **Word Formation**: Continue taking turns until you want to submit a word
5. **Scoring**: Press ENTER to submit the word. Valid words score points exponentially based on length:
   - 3 letters: 2 points

   - And so on...
